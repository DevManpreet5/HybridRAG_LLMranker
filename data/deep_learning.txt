Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. 
It has revolutionized areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
One of the major breakthroughs in deep learning came with the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-related tasks.
