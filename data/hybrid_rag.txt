A hybrid RAG system combines symbolic retrieval (like BM25) with neural dense retrieval and re-ranking using models like CrossEncoder.
This hybrid approach leverages the precision of symbolic methods and the contextual awareness of neural models.
It is particularly useful in enterprise applications where document relevance and correctness are critical.
